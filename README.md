# Mental Wellness Sentiment Dashboard

This is a web-based journaling app that analyzes emotional sentiment from daily journal entries using Natural Language Processing. Built with **Streamlit**, the dashboard lets you write personal thoughts, auto-classifies the mood (like *Happy*, *Anxious*, *Calm*, etc.), and visualizes emotional trends using interactive charts.
